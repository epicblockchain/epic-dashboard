EPIC BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES INC.
PRIVACY POLICY

Last Revised: July 13, 2020

Introduction

At ePIC Blockchain Technologies Inc. (“ePIC”, “We”, “Our”, or “Us” and terms of similar meaning), We are committed to your (“Your” and “You”) privacy.  This means We do not transfer, distribute, disclose, rent or sell any of Your personal information to third parties except as provided for in this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) or as specifically consented by You.
ePIC has developed policies and procedures consistent with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and other relevant privacy laws.  

By using (the word “use” in these TOU will mean “access or use”) Our Website located at www.epicblockchain.io (the “Website”), or by using the ePIC Mining Dashboard Application (the “Apps”), or any of the digital services and functionalities We make available via the Website and Apps (including any content therein)  (collectively, with the Website and Apps, the “Services”), You expressly consent to Our collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to Our Terms of Use.  

Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information (“Personal Information”) collected, used or disclosed by ePIC.  Personal Information is any information in any form that identifies or can identify an individual and includes any information provided to Us by You in using Our Services.

Accountability
ePIC is responsible for the Personal Information under Our possession and control.  We have designated a Privacy Officer to be responsible for Our compliance with this Privacy Policy and privacy legislation.

Information We Collect
None.

We respect Your privacy and, unless otherwise required by law, We will not collect, use or disclose Your Personal Information without Your prior consent. Your consent may be expressed or implied. You may expressly give Your consent in writing, verbally or through any electronic means.  In certain circumstances, Your consent may be implied by Your actions.  For example, providing Us Personal Information to register for Our Services is implied consent to use such information to provide You the associated services.

Where appropriate, ePIC will generally seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, if ePIC wants to use information for a purpose other than those identified above).  In obtaining consent, ePIC will use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer is advised of the identified purposes for which Personal Information collected will be used or disclosed.

The form of consent sought by ePIC may vary, depending upon the circumstances and type of information disclosed. In determining the appropriate form of consent, ePIC shall take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable expectations of Our Users.  ePIC will seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent will generally be appropriate where the information is less sensitive. 
You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. In order to withdraw consent, You must provide notice to ePIC in writing.  

Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention
Unless required by law, or in connection with a business transaction, Epic shall not use or disclose or transfer Personal Information for any purpose other than those described above without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining Your consent, where such consent may not reasonably be implied.
As noted above, ePIC does not disclose Your Personal Information to third parties.  Notwithstanding, Your Personal Information may be transferred to third party suppliers, contractors and agents (“Affiliates”) who are contracted by ePIC to assist it in providing and developing products and services.  Such Affiliates will only use Your Personal Information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.  In the event Your Personal Information is disclosed to a third party pursuant to a business transaction, ePIC will ensure that it has entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of the information is related to those purposes that relate to the transaction.
Subject to the foregoing, only ePIC’s and Our Affiliates’ employees with a business need to know, or whose duties reasonably so require, are granted access to Personal Information about Our Users.   All such employees will be required as a condition of employment to contractually respect the confidentiality of Our Users’ Personal Information.
ePIC will retain Personal Information for only as long as required to fulfill the identified purposes or as required by law. Personal Information that is no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes will be destroyed, erased or made anonymous according to the guidelines and procedures established by ePIC.

Law Enforcement Requests
We will disclose Personal Information without Your knowledge or consent if We receive an order, subpoena, warrant or other legal requirement issued by a court, tribunal, regulator or other person with jurisdiction to compel disclosure of Your Personal Information. If We receive a written request from a police officer or other law enforcement agency with authority to request access to Your Personal Information in the course of an actual or potential investigation into a breach of a law, Our policy is to provide the requested information.

Storage Outside of Canada
Your Personal Information may be used or stored by Us or Our service providers outside of Canada. We require that Our service providers safeguard Your Personal Information. However, if Your Personal Information is used or stored outside of Canada, it will also be subject to the laws of the country in which it is used or stored.

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 years.  We will not knowingly collect Personal Information about a child under the age of 13.
